            <h1>What is a Computer?</h1>
            <p>A computer is a device that transforms data into meaningful information. It processes the input according
                to the set of instructions provided to it by the user and gives the desired output. Computers are of
                various types and they can be categorized in two ways on the basis of size and on the basis of data
                handling capabilities.</p>
            <p>A computer is an electronic device that can process and store information. It can perform calculations,
                manipulate data, and execute instructions to accomplish specific tasks. The basic components of a
                computer include the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage (hard drive or solid-state
                drive), input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.), output devices (monitor, printer, etc.), and various
                peripheral devices (such as USB drives or external hard drives).</p>

            <h1>Types of Computer</h1>
            <p>There are two bases on which we can define the types of computers. We will discuss the type of computers
                on the basis of size and data handling capabilities. We will discuss each type of computer in detail.
                Letâ€™s see first what are the types of computers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Super Computer</li>
